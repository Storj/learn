# Introduction

Welcome to Storj! If you are reading this then you are probably trying to figure out how to use the Storj platform. We aim to be the one-stop guide to help you do just that! 

Keep in mind that while Storj is functional, there may be bugs or missing libaries/tools. We are an open-source platform so feel free to report the bugs directly on [Github](https://github.com/storj) or even make a pull request to fix the issue (if you are super cool). 

# Part I. Quickstart Guide
